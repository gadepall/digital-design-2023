\begin{enumerate}
\item In a given $8$-bit general purpose micro-controller there are following flags. $C$-Carry, $A$-Auxiliary Carry, $O$-Overflow flag, $P$-Parity ($0$ for even, $1$ for odd) $R0$ and $R1$ are the two general purpose registers of the micro-controller.After execution of the following instructions, the decimal equivalent of the binary sequence of the flag pattern $[CAOP]$ will be $\underline{\hspace{1cm}}$.\\


\begin{lstlisting}
MOV R0,+0x60
MOV R1,+0x46 
ADD R0,R1
\end{lstlisting}

\item 
Consider the given C-code and its corresponding assembly code, with a few operands U1-U4 being unknown. Some useful information as well as the semantics of each unique assembly instruction is annotated as inline comments in the code.

\item Which one of the following options is a CORRECT replacement 
for operands in the position (U1,U2,U3,U4) in the above 
assembly code?

\begin{enumerate}
\item (8,4,1,L02)                      
\item (3,4,4,L01)
\item (8,1,1,L02)                             
\item (3,1,1,L01)
