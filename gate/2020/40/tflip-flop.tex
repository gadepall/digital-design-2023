 Two T-flip flops are interconnected as shown in \figref{fig:tff1}. The present state of the flip flops are: $A = 1, B = 1$. The input x is given as $1, 0, 1$ in the next three clock cycles. The decimal equivalent of $(ABy)_{2}$ with A being the MSB and y being the LSB, after the 3\textsuperscript{rd} clock cycle is \rule{12mm}{0.4pt}
