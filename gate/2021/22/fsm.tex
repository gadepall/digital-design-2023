 A 16-bit synchronous binary up-counter is clocked with a frequency $f_{CLK}$ . The two most significant bits are OR-ed together to form an output Y. Measurements show that Y is periodic, and the duration for which Y remains high in each period is 24 ms. The clock frequency $f_{CLK}$ \underline{\hspace{1cm}} is  MHz. (Round off to 2 decimal places.)
